    Write a REST API in Flask/Django/GoGin/whatever hooked to a database like Postgres

    Make your web application create and consume content from the API, locally at first.

    Write Dockerfiles for both projects and publish to a container registry like ghcr.io

    Deploy both containers with the solution of your choice, be it on a single node Docker runtime, or even a Kubernetes cluster.

    Setup DNS records such as your-app.io and api.your-app.io that point to both production workloads, and have Let'sEncrypt give you TLS certificate to access both project over the internet via HTTPS.

    Make your production front-end communicate with your production API. Figure out what CORS is and why it may be a problem in that setup.

    Document everything in each projects README.md file.

    Write unit tests for both projects and end-to-end tests that make your front-end interacting with your API.

    Write CI pipelines that run tests automatically on every push.

    Write build pipelines that publish your containers automatically on each git tag of your main branch. Make sure to follow semantic versionning.
